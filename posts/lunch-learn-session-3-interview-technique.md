Interviews are not there to try and trip you up. The interviewers are looking for the right person for the job and will be wanting you to do well. They have put time into reading your CV and inviting you for an interview. They are interviewing you because they have already seen some potential in you want to meet face to face to see that your potential is the right fit for their company.

Stay calm and relaxed and remember that you are also using the interview to see if the role and company are the right fit for you.
